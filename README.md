# TurboPi

This repo tracks software and cronicles some fun we've had with the [Hiwonder](https://www.hiwonder.com/) [TurboPi robot car](https://www.hiwonder.com/collections/raspberrypi-bionic-robot/products/turbopi).

**Disclamer:** I'm not affiliated with Hiwonder in any way. This text just describe things I've explored with this robot kit on my own. I take no responsibility for others who may try to follow this as instructions. *Do not carry out any steps you do not understand well enough yourself so that you are sure that what you do is safe and will not damage anything.* In particular lithium-ion batteries are not safe if mishandled. If you let kids or others partake, they should be closely supervised.

The TurboPI is a very nice metallic robot car kit for a Raspberry PI (4b) with a bunch of sensors (4 motors, 4 mecanum wheels, camera mounted with two servos, line follower, ultrasonic sensor with multicolor LED lights). It comes with a set of software that allows fairly easily get started with getting the robot to do things.

# Assembly

HiWonder provides a [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFbzd0m6AcmLzo53o2Tsa20BS350rWGMj) of assembly instructions. 
However, note that the videos for some reason are out of order, and, in particular, there are quite a few feature videos mixed in among the others.
The right order appears to be this:

0. **Charge the batteries.**
   
   Depending on what kit you have, they may be included or not.
   I would suggest getting the kit with batteries since it can be a bit difficult to get the right ones.
   The specification says 2 x 18650, but apparently 18650 can come in slightly different sizes depending on the protective circuit included.
   My kit with batteries also included an everActive LC200 charger, which I didn't see specified anywhere (which had been nice to know, since this led me to order another one...)

1. **Check that you have the parts**
