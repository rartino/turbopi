# TurboPi

This repo tracks software and cronicles some fun we've had with the [Hiwonder](https://www.hiwonder.com/) [TurboPi robot car](https://www.hiwonder.com/collections/raspberrypi-bionic-robot/products/turbopi).

**Disclamer:** I'm not affiliated with Hiwonder in any way. This text just describe things I've explored with this robot kit on my own. I take no responsibility for others who may try to follow this as instructions. *Do not carry out any steps you do not understand well enough yourself so that you are sure that what you do is safe and will not damage anything.* In particular lithium-ion batteries are not safe if mishandled. If you let kids or others partake, they should be closely supervised.

The TurboPI is a very nice metallic robot car kit for a Raspberry PI (4b) with a bunch of sensors (4 motors, 4 mecanum wheels, camera mounted with two servos, line follower, ultrasonic sensor with multicolor LED lights). It comes with a set of software that allows fairly easily get started with getting the robot to do things.
